## Game Concept

It's a universal truth that no one can resist pressing a big RED button. The curiosity to see what happens next is irresistible.

> Why not design a game where the objective is to press as many buttons as possible?

### Mechanics

In addition to the intriguing buttons, the game introduces a unique element: self-cooperation. Unlike other games, each attempt aids the next one. You must strategize each round and collaborate with your future self to solve the puzzles.

## Technologies ðŸ¤“

### React + ThreeJS

I've been exploring ThreeJS for years. Initially, it was quite raw and challenging to manage. Similar to the evolution of web development, frameworks like React have revolutionized the field. I'm thrilled to see ThreeJS evolve into a more practical and user-friendly form, significantly accelerating the development process.

### ChatGPT and Copilot

Today's programmers are more fortunate than us a decade ago. We can now use ChatGPT to kickstart projects, rely on Copilot for code generation, and seek guidance from various sources.

### AI-Generated Content ðŸ¤–

As a science student, I lack artistic skills. Fortunately, AI can now inspire and assist us in creating our envisioned designs. AI-generated content, including these mind-bending materials, makes me wonder how long it will be before machines dominate the world.

### Serverless Architecture

The word "serverless" is a tricky term. When a user completes a puzzle or breaks a record, their score is uploaded to a server. However, we don't need to write any server-side code because all the back-end logic is handled within the front-end source code. This is the beauty of a serverless architecture.
